# Car-Price-Prediction
Business Problem:
The prices of new cars in the industry are fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a globally increase. As per the reports from Auto Car India, in FY2022, the no of old car users has been increased in massive rate.
There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features.
Business Goal:
The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the selling price. Using this model, to be able to predict cars market value can help for both kind of sellers (Dealers and Individual Sellers).
Project Objective:
We will convert this problem into a machine learning regression problem. We will build a predictive model to predict the selling price of old car.
